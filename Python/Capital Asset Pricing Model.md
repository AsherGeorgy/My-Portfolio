# **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**
## Introduction
This project provides a brief overview of the Capital Asset Pricing Model and its practical applications in financial analysis. Subsequently, it delves into the implementation of CAPM using Python, demonstrating how to calculate beta values and expected returns, and assess risk-adjusted returns using the Sharpe Ratio. 

Libraries required:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
```

### Expected return ($r_i$)
When an investor buys a share of a stock, they expect to earn a return that compensates them for the risk they're taking. <br><br>This compensation (return) is made up of a baseline risk-free return ($r_f$) and an additional return based on the risk of the stock, which is proportional to the overall market risk (equity risk premium), adjusted by the stock's sensitivity to market movements ($\beta_{im}$). <br> 

Thus the **expected return ($r_i$)** of a particular stock  is given by:

$$r_i = r_f + \beta_{im}(r_m-r_f)$$ 

where
>$r_f$ is the risk free rate <br>
>$\beta_{im}$ is the beta between the stock and the market <br>
>$r_m$ is the expected market return <br>
>$r_m - r_f$ is the equity risk premium

- **Risk free rate** is the return an investor would get from a completely safe, risk-free investment. In reality, there is always some level of risk, but for the sake of this formula, it is assumed there is a risk-free asset with no risk.

- **Expected market return** is the expected return of a well-diversified portfolio that represents the overall market. It's a measure of how the entire market is expected to perform. 

- **Equity risk premium** is the extra return that investors demand for holding a risky asset (like stocks) instead of a risk-free asset. It's essentially the additional compensation for taking on the risk associated with the stock market.



### **Beta ($\beta$)**

$\beta$ measures the sensitivity of a stock's returns to changes in the market.

$$\beta_x = \frac{{Cov}_{x,m}}{Var_m} $$ 
where 
> $x$ represents the asset <br>
> $m$ represents the market 

- A beta of 1 means the stock tends to move with the market. 
- A beta less than 1 indicates the stock is less volatile than the market.
- A beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility.

## CAPM with Python 
### 1. Retrieve stock data and calculate log returns: 

```python
def periodic_stock_returns(tickers, period, interval):
    """
    Download historical stock prices and calculate periodic returns.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    - tickers (list): List of stock tickers
    - period (str): Historical data period (e.g. "5y" for 5 years)
    - interval (str): Interval for data (e.g. "1mo" for 1 month)

    Returns:
    --------
    - data (DataFrame): DataFrame containing historical stock prices
    - returns (DataFrame): DataFrame containing periodic returns
    """    
    # Download historical stock prices using yfinance
    data = yf.download(tickers, period=period, interval=interval)['Adj Close']
    
    # Calculate periodic returns 
    returns = np.log(1 + data.pct_change()).dropna()
    
    return data, returns

# Example Usage
tickers = ['WMT','KO','LMT','PFE']
periodic_stock_returns(tickers, period="5y", interval="1mo")
```
This example code returns the 5 year monthly adjusted closing prices and log returns of Walmart Inc, Coca-Cola Co, Lockheed Martin Corp and Pfizer Inc.

### 2. Calculate Beta ($\beta_{im}$):
```python
def calculate_beta(tickers, market_index='^GSPC'):
    """
    Calculate beta values for given stocks with respect to a market index.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    - tickers (list): List of stock tickers
    - market_index (str): Ticker symbol of the market index (default: '^GSPC' for S&P 500)

    Returns:
    --------
    - beta_df (Series): Series containing beta values for each stock
    """  
    # Adding the market index to tickers list
    stocks = tickers + [market_index]

    # Download historical stock prices and returns
    stock_data = pd.DataFrame()
    stock_returns = pd.DataFrame()
    for t in stocks:
        try: 
            stock_data[t], stock_returns[t] = periodic_stock_returns(t)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f'Error downloading data for {t}: {e}')            

    # Calculate covariance matrix and extract market variance. 
    cov_matrix = stock_returns.cov() * 12
    var_market = cov_matrix.loc[market_index, market_index]

    # Calculate beta values
    beta_df = cov_matrix.loc[tickers, market_index]/var_market
    beta_df.name = 'Beta'

    return beta_df

# Example Usage
calculate_beta(tickers)
```
Note that Beta calculated in this example is 5Y monthly. This can be changed in the `periodic_stock_returns` function. 

### 3. Estimate expected returns ($r_i$):

A 10 year US government bond can be considered risk free. Its yield as of 13 March 2024 is 4.19% [(Bloomberg.com)](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us) <br>


```python
def capm_expected_return(tickers, risk_free_rate, risk_premium, market_index='^GSPC', print_info=False):
    """
    Calculate expected returns using Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

    Parameters:
    -----------
    - tickers (list): List of stock tickers
    - risk_free_rate (float): Risk-free rate of return
    - risk_premium (float): Expected risk premium
    - market_index (str): Ticker symbol of the market index (default: '^GSPC' for S&P 500)

    beta = calculate_beta(tickers, market_index=market_index)
    
    # Calculate CAPM return for each stock
    CAPM_return = risk_free_rate + beta * risk_premium
    
    # Print the expected return for each stock
    if print_info:
        print(f'The expected return of the given stocks as per Capital Asset Pricing Model:\n')
        for t in tickers:
            print(f'{t}: {CAPM_return.loc[t]*100:.2f}%')
    
    return CAPM_return

# Example Usage
capm_expected_return(tickers, 0.0417, 0.05)
```

# **Sharpe Ratio**

The Sharpe Ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return, commonly used to evaluate the performance of an investment or a portfolio. 
$$\frac{r_i-r_f}{\sigma_i}$$
where 
> $r_i$ is the average rate of return on the investment $i$.   <br>
> $r_f$ is the risk free rate. <br>
> $\sigma_i$ is the standard deviation of the investment. <br>

$r_i-r_f$ is the **excess return**, representing the return earned above the risk-free rate, while $\sigma_i$ is the **standard deviation** of the investment's returns. It serves as a measure of risk. 

By dividing the excess return by the risk, the Sharpe Ratio **quantifies how much return an investor is receiving per unit of risk taken**. 
Investors and fund managers often use the Sharpe Ratio to compare the risk-adjusted performance of different investments or portfolios. 
- Higher Sharpe Ratios are generally preferred, as they suggest a better trade-off between risk and return.
- It indicates if a certain investment fund is performing satisfactory on a risk adjusted basis (at the expense of a riskier portfolio.)


```python
def calculate_sharpe_ratio(tickers, risk_free_rate, risk_premium, market_index='^GSPC'):
    """

    Parameters:
    -----------

    - risk_free_rate (float): Risk-free rate of return
    - risk_premium (float): Expected risk premium
    - market_index (str): Ticker symbol of the market index (default: '^GSPC' for S&P 500)

    Returns:
    --------

    # Calculate periodic returns for the given tickers
    _, returns = periodic_stock_returns(tickers)
    
    # Calculate the average returns of the stocks
    average_returns = returns.mean()
    
    # Calculate the standard deviation of the average returns and annualize it
    std_dev = average_returns.std() * 250 ** 0.5
    
    # Calculate the Sharpe ratio using the CAPM expected return and standard deviation
    sharpe_ratio = (capm_exp_ret - risk_free_rate) / std_dev
    
    return sharpe_ratio

# Example Usage
calculate_sharpe_ratio(tickers, 0.0417, 0.05)
```

# **Additional Notes**

## **Alpha ($\alpha$)**

Alpha is a key metric used to evaluate the performance of an investment. It represents the excess return generated beyond what would be expected based on the inherent risks associated with the market. The standard CAPM setting assumes efficient financial market and therefore an $\alpha$ of zero. It is included in the augmented CAPM expected return formula:

$$r_i = \alpha + r_f + \beta_{im}(r_m-r_f)$$ 

- Given that $\beta$ multiplied by the equity risk premium gives us the compensation for risk that's been taken with the investment, $\alpha$ shows us how much return we get without bearing extra risk. 
- It provides insight into the baseline return, acting as a measure of intrinsic performance of an investement fund beyond market dynamics. Positive or negative values of $\alpha$ suggest either outperformance or underperformance relative to market expectations. 
- A practical implication is that a fund manager charging fees equivalent to 1% of the invested amount would need an $\alpha$ exceeding 1% to rationalize the associated costs.

Note that alpha is comparable only when the risk profile (beta) of the investments being compared is similar.
